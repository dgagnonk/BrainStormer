# BrainStormer
Not your typical word processor. Developed with novelists in mind. Comes with character and plot prompts, novel structuring hierarchy, the ability to take quick notes on every document, and total control with how the novel is structured. Documents can be saved as a BrainStormer project with the hierarchy intact, or exported as a typical Word document.

Created with C# and Winforms. .NET 4.5+ is suggested. Tested briefly on Linux using Mono (most issues come from project compression - Linux use is not suggested at this time).
